# Clicky Game

A memory game built using [React](reactjs.org).

The point of the game is to click each of the cards *only once* per game. If a card is clicked on a second time, the player loses and the game resets. Once all of the cards have been clicked on, the user wins and the game is over.

The app keeps track of 
- which cards have been clicked on so far
- the user's score
